| Unit I   | 1           | Introduction to Language Processors | Introduce participants to language processors, including compilers and their structure. Explore the phases of compilation and the science behind building a compiler. Cover basics of programming languages. | Chapters 1 and 2 from "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam. |
|          | 2           | Lexical Analysis                    | Explain the role of the lexical analyzer, input buffering, specification, and recognition of tokens. Discuss the design of lexical-analyzer generators like Lex.                                             | Chapter 3 from "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam.        |
| Unit II  | 3           | Syntax Analysis                     | Introduce syntax analysis, including writing grammars, lexical vs. syntactic analysis, and ambiguity elimination techniques. Cover top-down parsing, including LL(1) grammar and recursive descent parsing.  | Chapters 4 and 5 from "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam. |
|          | 4           | Bottom-Up Parsing                   | Cover bottom-up parsing techniques, including LR parsing and parser generators like YACC. Discuss LR parsing algorithms and parser generators.                                                               | Chapters 6 and 7 from "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam. |
| Unit III | 5           | Syntax-Directed Translation         | Explain syntax-directed translation, including syntax-directed definitions, evaluation orders, and implementation of SDDs. Discuss applications and schemes of syntax-directed translation.                  | Chapters 8 and 9 from "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam. |
